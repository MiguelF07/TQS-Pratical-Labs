# Lab 1 - Unit Testing (with JUnit 5)
1. Unit testing is when you (as a programmer) write test code to verify units of (production) code. A unit is a small, coherent subset of a much larger solution. A true “unit” should not depend of the behavior of other (collaborating) modules.
2. Unit tests help the developers to (i) understand the module contract (what to construct); (ii) document the intended use of a component; (iii) prevent regression errors; (iv) increase confidence in the code.

`assertEquals(msg,expected,result)`

`msg`is not required. It will only show when the test fails.

`expected`is the expected result and `result`is the actual result given.
